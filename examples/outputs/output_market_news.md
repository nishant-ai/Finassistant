---

Okay, here's a quick rundown of what's happening in the market today.

The U.S. stock market is showing mixed signals today. The Dow is fluctuating, but the S&P 500 is edging higher, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is making gains, largely driven by a surge in Amazon shares following their latest earnings report. It looks like the major indexes are on track to finish October with gains, despite ongoing concerns about a potential government shutdown.

Several factors are influencing market activity. Broadcom is attracting attention from growth investors due to its potential in the expanding AI market. Meanwhile, silver is holding steady as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst market volatility. Interestingly, banks are utilizing the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility at record levels, possibly due to month-end financial pressures. In other news, Eli Lilly has announced that its weight-loss pill could be fast-tracked for approval under a new U.S. program.

On the other hand, it seems like deals for home sales are increasingly falling through due to economic uncertainty, leading some sellers to pull their homes off the market. Also, Indian stock markets are experiencing a downturn, with both the Sensex and Nifty showing declines.
