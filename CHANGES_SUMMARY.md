# Codebase Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated all tool docstrings to make tool selection crystal clear for the LLM agent. The agent now has explicit guidance on when to use RAG tools vs real-time tools.

  - Web Search Tools (Real-Time Information)

### 6. New Files Created ðŸ“„

#### `/TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDE.md`
Comprehensive guide explaining:
- How the agent decides which tool to use
- Decision tree for all question types
- Complete tool list (22 active tools)
- RAG vs Non-RAG decision matrix
- Keywords that trigger specific tools
- Performance characteristics
- Test queries to verify tool selection
- Summary of when to use RAG vs real-time tools

#### `/CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
Summary of all changes made to the codebase.

## Key Improvements

### Before
- **Ambiguous docstrings**: Both RAG and basic tools said "use for SEC filing questions"
- **No clear hierarchy**: Agent could pick wrong tool
- **Missing context**: No explanation of trade-offs (speed vs accuracy)
- **Overlapping descriptions**: Multiple tools for same use case

### After
- **Clear primary tools**: "**PRIMARY TOOL for...**" markers
- **Explicit hierarchy**: RAG > Real-time APIs > Web search
- **Trade-off explanations**: Speed, coverage, accuracy noted
- **Distinct use cases**: Each tool has unique scenarios
- **Keywords guidance**: Helps LLM pattern match

## Tool Selection Hierarchy

### SEC Filing Questions
1. ðŸ¥‡ `semantic_search_sec_filing` (RAG) - DEFAULT, 95% of queries
2. ðŸ¥ˆ `get_sec_filing_summary` - Quick preview only
3. ðŸ¥‰ `search_sec_filing` - Exact phrases only (rare)

### News Questions
1. ðŸ¥‡ `get_stock_news` - Real-time company news
2. ðŸ¥‡ `get_market_news` - General market headlines
3. ðŸ¥ˆ `semantic_search_news` - Historical themes (requires indexing)

### Web Search
1. ðŸ¥‡ `financial_web_search` - Company-specific real-time
2. ðŸ¥‡ `real_time_market_search` - Market-wide breaking news
3. ðŸ¥‡ `web_search` - General real-time info
4. ðŸ¥ˆ `search_and_summarize` - Deep research

### Comprehensive Analysis
1. ðŸ¥‡ `multi_document_analysis` - ONLY tool for multi-source synthesis

---

## Testing Recommendations

Run these commands to verify the agent picks the correct tools:

```bash
# Test 1: Should use semantic_search_sec_filing (RAG)
python agent/app.py "What are Apple's main risks according to their 10-K?"

# Test 2: Should use get_stock_news (real-time)
python agent/app.py "What's the latest news about Apple?"

# Test 3: Should use web_search (real-time)
python agent/app.py "What is Apple's stock price right now?"

# Test 4: Should use multi_document_analysis (comprehensive RAG)
python agent/app.py "Give me a comprehensive analysis of Microsoft's cloud strategy"

# Test 5: Should use get_valuation_metrics (quantitative)
python agent/app.py "What is Tesla's P/E ratio?"

# Test 6: Should use get_market_news (general headlines)
python agent/app.py "What's the market news today?"
```

## Impact on Agent Behavior

### What Changed
- **Tool selection accuracy**: LLM now has clear guidance
- **RAG usage**: Will default to RAG for SEC filing questions
- **Real-time prioritization**: Will use APIs before web search when available
- **Reduced ambiguity**: Distinct use cases prevent wrong tool selection

### What Stayed the Same
- **Tool functionality**: No changes to tool logic
- **API integration**: Same data sources
- **Agent architecture**: Same LangGraph flow
- **Number of tools**: 22 active tools (removed 1 deprecated)

---

## Benefits

1. **Better tool selection**: LLM picks the right tool more consistently
2. **Faster responses**: Real-time tools used when appropriate
3. **More accurate results**: RAG used for deep semantic search
4. **Clear documentation**: Easy for developers to understand tool hierarchy
5. **Maintainability**: Clear patterns for adding new tools

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Monitor tool usage**: Log which tools get selected for different query types
2. **A/B testing**: Compare tool selection accuracy before/after changes
3. **Add more examples**: Expand example queries in docstrings based on real usage
4. **Tool analytics**: Track tool performance and success rates
5. **User feedback loop**: Allow users to indicate if wrong tool was selected

---

## Summary

All tool docstrings have been updated with:
- âœ… Clear "PRIMARY" or "LEGACY" markers
- âœ… Explicit "When to use" and "When NOT to use" sections
- âœ… Performance characteristics (speed, coverage)
- âœ… Better example queries
- âœ… Cross-references to alternative tools
- âœ… Keywords that trigger each tool
- âœ… Trade-off explanations (RAG vs real-time)

The agent now has clear guidance to:
1. **Default to RAG** for SEC filing content analysis
2. **Use real-time APIs** for current news and data
3. **Fall back to web search** for very recent information
4. **Combine sources** for comprehensive analysis

This ensures optimal tool selection for each type of user query.
