# Finassistant: An Agentic AI Financial Analyst

[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**Finassistant** is an agentic AI analyst designed to synthesize complex financial information from disparate sources (SEC filings, news, market data) into actionable, evidence-backed reports. It moves beyond simple data retrieval to perform multi-step reasoning via a multi-agent workflow, providing users with insights that would typically require hours of manual research.

> **Note:** This project is currently in the initial development phase.

### ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Utilizes a sophisticated architecture where an **Orchestrator Agent** delegates tasks to specialized agents (e.g., `SEC_Filing_Analyst`, `Quantitative_Analyst`) for deeper, more accurate analysis.
  * **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implements **Hierarchical RAG** to efficiently parse and query dense, lengthy financial documents like SEC 10-K filings.
  * **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuned Model:** Leverages a fine-tuned transformer model for nuanced sentiment analysis on financial news, providing more accurate insights than generic models.
  * **Production-Grade MLOps:** The entire application is containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)** using a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions.

### üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is designed as a modern, distributed application deployed on AWS, ensuring scalability and robustness.

-----

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  * **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph
  * **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Chart.js
  * **Databases:** ChromaDB (Vector Search), Neo4j (Graph RAG - Planned), Redis (Caching)
