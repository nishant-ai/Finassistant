## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named agent"
```bash
# Run from the Finassistant directory:
cd /Users/nishant/Desktop/Finassistant
python -m agent.app_multi_agent "[Chat] test"
```

### Issue: "API key not found"
```bash
# Make sure .env file exists and has:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Issue: Slow responses
- **Chat mode** should be ~10 seconds
- **Report mode** can take 60-90 seconds (this is normal)
- Check your internet connection for web search tools

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Try the examples**:
   ```bash
   python examples/multi_agent_examples.py demo
   ```

2. **Read full documentation**:
   - See [MULTI_AGENT_README.md](MULTI_AGENT_README.md)

3. **Explore available tools**:
   - See [MULTI_AGENT_README.md#-available-tools-23-total](MULTI_AGENT_README.md#-available-tools-23-total)

4. **Run in interactive mode**:
   ```bash
   python -m agent.app_multi_agent
   ```

## üéì Learning Path

### Beginner
1. Start with simple [Chat] queries
2. Try different companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA, AMZN, NVDA)
3. Experiment with comparisons

### Intermediate
1. Use length customization
2. Try [Report] mode for deeper analysis
3. Combine multiple aspects (valuation + news)

### Advanced
1. Compare 3+ companies
2. Request specific tool combinations
3. Use for research workflows

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: "What's Apple's P/E ratio?" is better than "Tell me about Apple"

2. **Use tickers**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL (uppercase works best)

3. **Choose the right mode**:
   - Need quick answer? Use [Chat]
   - Need full analysis? Use [Report]

4. **Customize length**: Add "brief", "detailed", or specific paragraph counts

5. **Chain queries**: Use interactive mode for follow-up questions

## üö® Common Mistakes
